# Density
Shiny app for some continuous density distribution 

The app provides an intutive and comprehensive visualization of some continuous distribution such as Normal, Student's t, Chi-Squared, Exponential and Fisher. The original code is writen by [Irvin Alcaraz](https://gist.github.com/calpolystat/200f26d243f4f5bb7334) and modified to provide a visualization rendered with `ggplotly`.

When the app first renders, the user is shown by default the standard normal distribution and parameters corresponding to the distribution of their choice from the options under "Distribution".

You can see the app in action [here](https://mohamed-essaied-hamrita.shinyapps.io/Density/).
